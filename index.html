    <p>Hi Iâ€™m Harry Potter and I am a Beagle Jack Russell Terrier mix and pet
      of the Miller-Kodz family!</p>

    <p>I was rescued when I was just a puppy in 2010, but no one was really sure how old I was at the time. My family thinks I am about
      12 years old, so I am considered an old man now! My family also just decided to get a new puppy, Lola; she has been living with
      us for the last 8 months now, and boy does she make life tough. She is always so energetic running and jumping and barking and
      trying to play when really I just want to relax and sleep. Hopefully she calms down soon so I can go back to enjoying my peaceful
      days.</p>
