    <p>Hi Iâ€™m Harry Potter and I am a Beagle Jack Russell Terrier mix and pet
      of the Miller-Kodz family!</p>

    <p>I was rescued when I was just a puppy in 2010, but no one was really sure how old I was at the time. My family thinks I am about
      12 years old now, so I am considered an old man now! Beagles are a hunting breed normally used to hunt rabbits, and when I was
      younger my Dad would me out to hunt woodland game birds like pheasants, quail, and woodcock; but now that I am an old man I
      get to just relax at home.</p>
